# NEC Activity 1: Neural Network with Back-Propagation

## Overview
Implementation of a from-scratch Neural Network with comparison to scikit-learn models for the Ames Housing dataset.

## Files
- `NeuralNet.py`: Custom neural network implementation
- `app.ipynb`: Main analysis notebook
- `preprocessed_data.npz`: Preprocessed dataset

## Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset
Download `train.csv` from [Kaggle House Prices Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) and place it in the root directory.

## Running
Open `app.ipynb` in Jupyter and run all cells sequentially.

## Results
- Best custom BP model: MAE ~$[YOUR_VALUE]
- Gradient Boosting: MAE ~$[YOUR_VALUE] (best overall)
